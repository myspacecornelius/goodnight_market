## 🌟 The Vision

**Dharma isn't just another sneaker bot.** It's the foundation for a new kind of sneaker community—one that rewards authenticity, celebrates local culture, and puts power back in the hands of real enthusiasts.

### What We're Building

- **🗺️ Hyperlocal Heatmaps**: Real-time signals from sneakerheads in your city
- **🪙 LACES Token Economy**: Earn rewards for contributing to the community  
- **🎯 Drop Zones**: Coordinate releases, share intel, build together
- **🤝 Community-First**: No gatekeeping, no backdoors—just pure sneaker culture
- **🔒 Privacy by Design**: Your data stays yours, always

### Why It Matters

The sneaker game has been hijacked by corporate interests and exclusive access. **Dharma brings it back to the streets.** We're creating infrastructure that serves the community, not just the highest bidder.
